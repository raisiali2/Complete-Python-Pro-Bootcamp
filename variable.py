#print( len( input("what is your name: ") ) )

# now i want to rewrite the code with variable that we can to refer and access it anytime


name = "ali"
print(name)

name = "ahmad"
print(name)

# this variable each of them taking different value and it makes coding very easy

# if we write the previous program using variable we can write it more explicit and readable way
name = input("enter your name?")
length = len(name)
print(length)
