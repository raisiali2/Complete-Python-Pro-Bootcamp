## Python Variables

```python
input("what is your name")
```
Once we run this it ask for name, when we enter nothing happen but behind the seen it receive by the function, the idea is that once done it disapear and there is no way to refer to it in the future.

```python
name = input("what is your name")
print(name)
```
Now we save the data from this action in a variable called `name` it allows us to later on we can refer to it and get the value of it at anytime.

Another example you think if you have a phone book write down the numbers of people the next time if you look at it there is no way for you to know whos number that is? in a sense it is the same thing with computer even though with inputed this piece of data `012 534 5769` there is no way fo us to refer to this data unless we give it a name like `James:012 534 5769`
