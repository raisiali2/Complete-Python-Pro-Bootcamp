## Python Variables

```python
input("what is your name")
```
Once we run this it ask for name, when we enter nothing happen but behind the seen it receive by the function, the idea is that once done it disapear and there is no way to refer to it in the future.

```python
name = input("what is your name")
print(name)
```
Now we save the data from this action in a variable called `name` it allows us to later on we can refer to it and get the value of it at anytime.

Another example you think if you have a phone book write down the numbers of people the next time if you look at it there is no way for you to know whos number that is? in a sense it is the same thing with computer even though with inputed this piece of data `012 534 5769` there is no way fo us to refer to this data unless we give it a name like `James:012 534 5769` and in programming we call tis name`james = 0125345769` this means in the future when we want to refer to it by it name.


As the name variable suggest it can be changed or varied for example
```python
name = "jack"
print(name)
```
Now we refer to that peice of data by the variable `name` but if later on i give a different piece of data to take
```python
name = "Angela"
print(name)
```
In the second time it take Angela, it make a lot easier when we write code for 
```python
last example:
print( len( input("what is your name?) ) )
```
which is long and confusing, instead we can use variable to write it.  
```python
name = input("what is your name?")
length = len(name)
print(length)
``` 
in the above case the data of `input()` function stored in the variable `name` and then function `len()` applied on it, the output stored in variable `length` then print the variable `length`.  

Now we have all peice of data which associated with `name` we can refer to it anytime and access to its data.
